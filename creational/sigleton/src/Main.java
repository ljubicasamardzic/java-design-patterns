        // Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of the singleton class.
        // When the singleton class is loaded, SingletonHelper class is not loaded into memory and only when someone calls the getInstance() method,
        // this class gets loaded and creates the singleton class instance.
        // This is the most widely used approach for the singleton class as it doesnâ€™t require synchronization.
